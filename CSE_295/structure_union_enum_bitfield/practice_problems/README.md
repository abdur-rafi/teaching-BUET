# Practice Problems: Struct, Union, and Enum

## Struct
1. Define a structure to store information about a student (name, roll, marks). Write a program to input and display the data of 5 students.
2. Write a program to sort an array of structures (students) by marks in descending order.

## Union
1. Define a union to store either an integer, a float, or a character. Write a program to demonstrate how only one member can be used at a time.
2. Write a program to compare the memory size of a structure and a union with the same members.

## Enum
1. Define an enum for the days of the week. Write a program to print the name of the day based on user input (0-6).
2. Use an enum to represent traffic light colors. Write a function that takes the enum value and prints the corresponding action (e.g., RED = Stop).

## Combined Concepts
1. Define a structure for an employee that contains a union for storing either a phone number (as int) or an email (as string), and an enum for the employee's department. Write a program to input and display employee details.
2. Write a program to store and display information about vehicles, where each vehicle has a type (enum: CAR, TRUCK, BIKE), and a union for either engine capacity (int) or battery capacity (float), depending on the type. Use a structure to represent the vehicle.

## Open-Ended Design Problems
1. Hospital Management System: You need to store information about patients (name, age, gender, blood group, admission status), doctors (name, specialization, contact info), and appointments (date, time, patient, doctor, type: checkup/surgery/emergency). Design appropriate structs, unions, and enums to represent this information.
2. University Course Registration: Store information for students (name, ID, year, status: full-time/part-time), courses (code, title, credits, type: core/elective/lab), instructors (name, department), and enrollment (student, course, grade as letter or percentage). Specify how you would structure this using structs, unions, and enums.
