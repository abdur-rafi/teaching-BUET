# Loop Practice Problems

## Multiplication Table
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and prints the multiplication table up to 10.

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 5
```

**Sample Output:**
```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

## Factorial Of A Number
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and prints `n!`.

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 5
```

**Sample Output:**
```
120
```

## Fibonacci Series (First N Terms)
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and prints the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci series.

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 7
```

**Sample Output:**
```
0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```

## Sum of Digits
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and prints the sum of the digits of that number.

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 1234
```

**Sample Output:**
```
10
```

## Prime Checker
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and checks if it is prime.

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 29
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Prime
```

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 30
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Not Prime
```

## Pascal's Triangle
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and prints the first `n` rows of Pascal's Triangle. For example, if `n = 5`, the output should have 5 rows.

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 5
```

**Sample Output:**
```
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

## Armstrong Numbers (3 Digits)
Write a program that finds and prints all 3-digit Armstrong numbers. An Armstrong number is a number such that the sum of its digits raised to the power of 3 equals the number itself.

## Printing Patterns
Write programs to print the following patterns based on an integer input `n`.

### Pattern 1: Right-Angled Triangle (For n = 5)
**Sample Input:**
```
n = 5
```

**Sample Output:**
```
