# Loop Practice Problems

## Multiplication Table
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and prints the multiplication table up to 10.

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 5
```

**Sample Output:**
```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
```

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 1234
```

**Sample Output:**
```
4321
```

## Palindrome Checker
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and checks if it is a palindrome.

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 121
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Palindrome
```

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 123
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Not Palindrome
```

## Perfect Number Checker
Write a program that takes an integer input `n` and checks if it is a perfect number. A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 28
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Perfect Number
```

**Sample Input:**
```
n = 12
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Not a Perfect Number
```

## GCD of Two Numbers
Write a program that takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` and prints their greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Sample Input:**
```
a = 56, b = 98
```

**Sample Output:**
```
14
```

## LCM of Two Numbers
Write a program that takes two integer inputs `a` and `b` and prints their least common multiple (LCM).

**Sample Input:**
```
a = 4, b = 6
```

**Sample Output:**
```
12
```
