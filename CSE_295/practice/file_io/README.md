# C File I/O — Practice Problems 

## Warm-up
1) Echo file: Read a text file and print it to stdout exactly.
2) Copy text file: Copy source.txt to dest.txt (overwrite if exists). Keep identical content.
3) Append: Append the entire content of b.txt to the end of a.txt.
4) Count stats: Count characters, words, and lines in a text file. Define a word as a maximal sequence of non-whitespace.

## Parsing and analysis
5) Letter frequency: Count frequency of a–z ignoring case. Output sorted by letter.
6) Longest line: Find the length of the longest line and print that line.
7) Trim extra spaces: Collapse multiple spaces to a single space within lines (do not alter tabs). Write to a new file.
8) Remove blank lines: Delete lines that are empty or contain only whitespace.
9) Detab: Replace each tab with 4 spaces.
10) Unique words: Output unique words (case-insensitive) sorted alphabetically, one per line.
11) Vowel/consonant/digit/space/punct counts: Print totals for each category.

## Transformations
12) Case convert: Create three outputs — all-uppercase, all-lowercase, and toggle-case.
13) Wrap at width: Reflow text to wrap at 80 columns without breaking words.
14) Reverse-in-line: For each line, reverse the characters of that line.
15) Reverse lines order: Write the lines in reverse order. Hint: read all lines into memory (dynamic array) then write back; 

## File comparison and merging
16) Diff (first mismatch): Compare two text files and print the first differing line and column. If equal, say so.
17) Remove consecutive duplicates: From an input file, remove consecutive duplicate lines.
18) Interleave: Write lines alternately from a.txt and b.txt; if one ends, continue with the other.


## Logs and utilities
19) Filter lines by keyword: Read a text file and write only the lines that contain a given word or phrase (case-insensitive) into hits.txt.
20) First/last N lines: Write two programs. One prints the first N lines of a text file. The other prints the last N lines.
21) Split by lines: Split a large text file into chunks of at most K lines each; name out_001.txt, out_002.txt, ...
