# C String Practice Problems (Basic → Moderate)

## Basic
- Implement `strlen` (no library calls).
- Reverse a string in place.
- Safe `strcpy` with max buffer size (avoid overflow).
- `strcmp`: lexicographic compare of two strings.
- Count vowels, consonants, digits, spaces, others.
- Toggle case (upper ↔ lower) for letters.
- Palindrome check ignoring case and non‑alphanumerics.
- Remove all occurrences of a given character.
- Trim leading/trailing spaces; also remove all spaces (two variants).
- Count words in a sentence.

## Intermediate
- Count occurrences of a substring (allow overlaps).
- Find the first non‑repeating character.
- Remove duplicate characters while preserving order.
- Split into words without `strtok` (manual parsing).
- Normalize spaces: collapse multiple spaces into one.
- Title‑case each word; preserve apostrophes/hyphens.
- Check if two strings are anagrams (ignore case/spaces).

## Advanced
- Implement `atoi` with trimming, +/- sign, overflow detection.
- Replace all occurrences of a substring with another.
- Longest common prefix among N strings.
- Big integer addition using strings.
- Word frequency in a paragraph (case‑fold, strip punctuation).
- Simple email address validator (basic rules).
