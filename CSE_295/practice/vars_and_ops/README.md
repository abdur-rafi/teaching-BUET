1. **Check if a number is even or odd**  
    Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints `1` for even numbers and `0` for odd numbers.  
    **Sample Input/Output**:  
    - Input: `4`  
      Output: `1`  
    - Input: `7`  
      Output: `0`  

2. **Extract the last digit of a number**  
    Write a program to extract and print the second digit of a given number.  
    **Sample Input/Output**:  
    - Input: `123`  
      Output: `2`  
    - Input: `4567`  
      Output: `6`  

3. **Check if a year is a leap year**  
    Write a program to determine whether a given year is a leap year. Print `1` for leap years and `0` otherwise.  
    **Hint**: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.  
    **Sample Input/Output**:  
    - Input: `2020`  
      Output: `1`  
    - Input: `1900`  
      Output: `0`  

4. **Swap two variables without using a third variable**  
    Write a program to swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.  

5. **Find the maximum and minimum of three numbers**  
    Write a program to determine the largest of three numbers. The output should consist of 3 bits:  
    - The first bit should be `1` if the first number is the largest, otherwise `0`.  
    - The second bit should be `1` if the second number is the largest, otherwise `0`.  
    - The third bit should be `1` if the third number is the largest, otherwise `0`.  

    **Sample Input/Output**:  
    - Input: `3 7 5`  
        Output: `0 1 0`    


6. **Convert an integer to binary (0 to 15)**  
    Write a program that takes an integer between 0 and 15 as input and prints its 4 bit binary representation.  
    **Hint**: Use repeated division by 2 and store remainders.  
    **Sample Input/Output**:  
    - Input: `5`  
      Output: `0101`  
    - Input: `12`  
      Output: `1100`
